                                <!--<p>If you are a genuine individual retail investor, looking for unbiased and independent advice from professional you are welcome! Also, if you are individual investment professional or a wealth management firm looking for a technical solution to manage your clients efficiently, improve your decision making related to clients' investments you are also most welcome!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>-->
                                <!--<p><strong>Retail Investors&rsquo; ultimate goal is to accumulate wealth to become financially independent or if one is already financially independent, then maximise or maintain the wealth level after spending for a given risk tolerance, short and long-term liquidity need, tax concerns, time horizon, and legal-regulatory considerations</strong>.</p>-->
                                <!--<p>Considering this ultimate goal in mind, the kind of major investment advice (<strong>Independent&nbsp;and unbiased</strong>) to retail investor is <strong>how one should distribute the current wealth</strong> among the different asset classes (e.g. Real Estate, Equity, Fixed Income, Cash and Alternate Investment) <strong>known as</strong> <strong>Asset Allocation</strong> and <strong>how one should distribute the ongoing and future investments (e.g. SIPs)</strong> among the asset classes (<strong>rational is to stick to Strategic Asset Allocation at any point in time</strong>).</p>-->
                                <!--<p>Now, there are <strong>two aspects of Investment Advice</strong>/<strong>Guidance</strong> related to wealth distribution - Part of an advice is <strong>based on investment theory</strong> which has evolved so far over the last few decades. With regard to this part, you will observe a high degree of consensus opinion among professionals. To some extent, Strategic Asset Allocation is somewhat related to this part. And the other part is <strong>based on the judgement of the adviser or fund/investment/wealth manager</strong>, especially related to a forecast of the future performances of asset classes or securities or a specific investment. There is a high probability of dispersion in advice among professionals e.g. one professional may believe that a particular asset-class is overvalued and exposure to that asset class needs to be reduced to a lower range (range is specified as part of the Strategic Asset Allocation). But at the same time, other professional may believe the other way. Usually, this is called <strong>Tactical Asset Allocation</strong>.</p>-->
                                <!--<p>To give an unbiased independent advice, a professional needs to know certain information. Giving an unbiased independent advice consumes a very small amount of time compared to gathering relevant factual and situational information.</p>-->
                                <!--<p>Types of information that needs to be captured:</p>-->
                                <!--<ul>-->
                                    <!--<li><strong>Relatively Static Information</strong> that will usually not change over a short period of time (1 year) e.g. family background (earning and dependent members), income source, the stability of income source (e.g. job security), behavioural biases and willingness to accept the risk, short and long-term liquidity need (financial goals)</li>-->
                                    <!--<li><strong>Information that is required to be updated regularly</strong> either by an investor or by someone on behalf of the investor e.g. transactions on new investment or liquidating existing investment</li>-->

                                <!--<p>This web application will capture relevant information and provide basic advice related to current asset allocation and ongoing investments (SIPs), paid advice from external professionals (expert in tax, property etc.) or any specific advice from anyone among a list of professionals.</p>-->
                                <!--<p>There are existing web applications (portfolio management) like MoneyControl, ET Portfolios but certainly, they lack some features. My earlier web application - <a href="http://www.twealthbook.com"><strong><u>twealthbook.com</u></strong></a> - was not so useful to the retail investors. (It is more suitable for professional PMS services).

                                    The greatest thing in life is FREEDOM! There can be no real freedom without a reasonable degree of financial independence. It is a terrible thing to be compelled to be at a certain place, at a certain task (perhaps a task which one does not like) for a certain number of hours every working day of the week, for a whole life-time. In some ways this is the same as being in prison, since one's choice of action is always limited. It is really no better than being in prison with the privilege of a "trusty," and in some ways it is even worse because the man who is imprisoned has escaped the responsibility of providing a place to sleep, something to eat and clothes to wear.
                                    The only hope of escape from this life-long toil which curtails freedom is to form the <strong> habit of saving money, and then live up to that habit, no matter how much sacrifice it may require. </strong> There is no other way out for millions of people, and unless you are one of the rare exceptions this lesson and all these statements of fact are meant for YOU, and apply to you!

                                    I don’t have any trading secrets that guarantee stock-picking success. If I did, I would be selfishly hoarding them on a private tropical island I’d purchase with the windfall. In truth, it’s not that I haven’t found them, but that they don’t actually exist. Through my entire career working with hundreds of sell-side analysts at Wall Street’s largest firms to the thousands of clients I’ve met, <strong> I’ve never come across a low-risk, high-return investment strategy that could be used with consistency.</strong>
